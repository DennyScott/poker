* Assumed that if players tied on a combination (pair), the player with the higher number combo won. 
* You cannot override a previous player with the same name. You would need to reset the game.
* Assumed that if players tied on one combination, and had equal numbers, that we would pass through other combinations until a winner was found. Finally, we use the high card to find a winner. If those are equal, then it is a tie.
